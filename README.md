# A Survey Form
A simple project to earn freeCodeCamps's Responsive Web Design Certification. 
  
  ## Prelude
  By working on this project, you will get a chance to apply all of the skills, principles, and concepts you have learned so far: HTML, CSS, Visual Design, Accessibility, and more.

## About
  I just tried to get to know with main principles of building a simple Survey Form and put it together with some basic styling methods to attract
  Web Viewers with diffrent visual tastes.
